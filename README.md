all code is based on [ppy's osu!lazer project](https://github.com/ppy/osu). ppy pls don't sue me

# libosu

libosu is a library meant to implement the source code of osu!lazer to C. This is due to the fact that it writing code in C using C# libraries either seems to be difficulty or impossible (due to how C works), as there is a lack of information on how to do so. This library only aims to code the functionality and allow for the user's to output the data; not coding the GUI game itself.
