REDO EVERYTHING

Do each function and typedef documentation with links to the osu source code
Refactor the test file and make a vigorous amount of test files that actually test things
Tie the `Slider` to the `JuiceStream`
Implement ctb's `Processor`'s hyperdashes
Figure out how `Storyboard`/`Event` works and implement it
Give a reason for files `std.c` and `ctb.c` to exist
Change all for loops to a pointer counter: https://youtu.be/443UNeGrFoM?t=4060
Change all Unions to a sort of inheritance: https://youtu.be/443UNeGrFoM?t=4296
Change all Pointers in structs to empty arrays: https://youtu.be/443UNeGrFoM?t=6322
Change all relational variables to `name_relation` for consistency
Redo functions with a void return to always at least return something if required to return more than one item since C doesn't handle multiple returns
Prioritise functions to have pointers as arguments to be the return value and non pointer arguments as read only arguments
Don't make the `variable++` as their own line but tied to the line they are in/decrementing
Use `stdint` instead of the inconsistent types that C provides
When allocing, pre-increment the length variable on the same line as the alloc and use the length variable `- 1`
Make every function that requires a pointer to be checked for memory safety
Make every alloced variable to be assigned all of it's fields before used.
Redo all files (including other projects) to have the header files include necessary files
