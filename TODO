Do each function and typedef documentation with links to the osu source code
Refactor the test file and make a vigorous amount of test files that actually test things
Tie the `Slider` to the `JuiceStream`
Implement ctb's `Processor`'s hyperdashes
Figure out how `Storyboard`/`Event` works and implement it
Give a reason for files `std.c` and `ctb.c` to exist
Make `Makefile` install/use pkg-config
Change all for loops to a pointer counter: https://youtu.be/443UNeGrFoM?t=4060
Change all Unions to a sort of inheritance: https://youtu.be/443UNeGrFoM?t=4296
Change all Pointers in structs to empty arrays: https://youtu.be/443UNeGrFoM?t=6322
Change all relational variables to `name_relation` for consistency
Prioritise functions with a void return since C doesn't handle multiple returns
Prioritise functions to have pointers as arguments to be the return value and non pointer arguments as read only arguments
Don't make the `variable++` as their own line but tied to the line they are de/incrementing
Use `stdint` instead of the inconsistent types that C provides
When allocing, pre-increment the length variable on the same line as the alloc and use the length variable `- 1`
Make setters to set variables of a struct that relies on other variables (I don't see a valid need for getters since you can just read from it already)
